### Very much a work in progress

don't use this yet. this is just a proof of concept that you can use rhai_egui on both native and web to script egui.

we provide a basic live version at coderedart.github.io/rhai_egui

if you want to try this offline, clone the repo and:
1. native. just do `cargo run` to run it.
2. web. just run `trunk serve` and open `localhost:8080` in the browser.


you can try changing text that gets logged at a `warn` level in console on web / terminal on native and see the changes live.
